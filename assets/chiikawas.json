        "description": "《吉伊卡哇》系列中的主要角色之一。是吉伊和小八的好朋友，以兔子為原型。身體小小的，身體的毛髮是黃色，尾巴為白色的大絨球。靠除草、採集和討伐為生，已考取三級除草證。性格活潑，精力充沛，無所畏懼，面對困難會想出很多點子。看似大條和無所謂，但會在乎朋友們。樂於和朋友們分享食物，在朋友遇到困難時陪伴和保護對方，對抗敵人。會發出各種奇特的叫聲來表達和溝通，如「烏拉」「呀哈」等，情緒高漲地跑來跑去。行為難以預測，經常有出其不意的舉動。戰鬥力較強，在緊要關頭能帶領同伴們扭轉局勢。經常在二手店購入奇怪的道具。有時會拿來可疑的物品，也有因此受到詛咒的時候。彈吉他的技藝高超。在地下洞穴里的酒吧當過DJ，用樹葉摩擦橡子發出音樂聲。私生活充滿謎團。"
